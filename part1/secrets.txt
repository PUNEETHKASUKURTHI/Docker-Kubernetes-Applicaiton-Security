For the first part I have gone through the various files

    GiftcardSite/GiftcardSite/settings.py
    GiftcardSite/LegacySite/views.py
    GiftcardSite/k8/django-deploy.yaml
    db/k8/db-deployment.yaml

Here in 
GiftcardSite/k8/django-deploy.yaml
db/k8/db-deployment.yaml           I could see the MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD which is open and can be seen by anyone

so I converted the password into base64 using 
echo -n 'thisisatestthing.' | base64

And put this password into a .yaml file that reads in the secrets and named it as part1-secrets.yaml

Kubectl apply -f part1-secrets.yaml and this applies the secrets and we can see that a secret is created

hence one secret is created

If we go through the GiftcardSite/GiftcardSite/settings.py we could see that the SECRET_KEY is visible 
So we hide this key and add an evironment variable such that secret can be protected

SECRET_KEY = os.environ.get('part1-django-secrets')

so first we put this secret key into a .txt file using the command
Kubectl create secret generic django-secrets --from-file=./django-secretkey.txt

we get an out put in .yaml file which has this secret key and now we can check the secrets using

kubectl get secrets

Now we change these values in the main 
GiftcardSite/k8/django-deploy.yaml
db/k8/db-deployment.yaml

after editing these values above delete all the pods with the command kubectl delete pods --all

and restart all the process of building applying docker build such that all the secrets are secured

now you check the server using the commmand
kubectl port-forward service/proxy-service 7080:8080
