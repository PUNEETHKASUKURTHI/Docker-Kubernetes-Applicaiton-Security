For the 2nd part of the assignment ie. 

As suggested in the instructions i checked the views.py file,
Here i found that while using prometheus monitoring statements the "Passwords" are getting printed out

"THe total number of times(pword)was used" is being printed , so make the passwords safe I found out the code thats doing this in the views.py and removed it

As per part 2.2 to add an additional parameter to monitor the server, I used
 increment through counter such that it could return "Number of times 404 msg is returned" when ever there is a "database_error_return_404" database_error_return_404
 graphs['database_error_return_404'].inc() 


Installing prometheus I used helm to install prometheus

Installing helm

I searched in google used the following commands to install helm

helm repo add prometheus-community https://prometheus-community.github.io/helm-charts
 after this the repo gets added into our database and to update I used
helm repo update

later on to continue the installing I used the following command

helm install prometheus-community/prometheus --generate-name 
and this successfully installed prometheus

To check its working i checked pods.

"kubectl get pods" and found out that Prometheus is successfully running
 and kubectl get serices and found out that these are running
 prometheus-alertmanager   1      60s
 prometheus-server         5      60s

To find out the prometheus process config I used kubectlget config and later to edit and put those into a .yaml files I used 

kubectl edit configmap prometheus-server 
kubectl get configmap prometheus-alertmanager -o yaml 

edited the server with the local host in target of prometheus as port 9090 to “proxy-service:8080” as mentioned in the instructions


At the end to check the Prometheus monitoring system and deploy it I forwarded the port as mentioned in the instructions

kubectl port-forward deployment/prometheus-server and we can see that prometheus running in website and monitoring various activities
